# Rentovate

Landing site for Rentovate — a rent-arbitrage company that provides landlords with guaranteed agreed rent plus a share of net profits from short-term bookings while managing cleaning, maintenance and guest screening.

This repository contains a minimal, static HTML/CSS site optimized for quick preview and deployment.

What I included
- Clean, Apple‑inspired layout with generous whitespace and subtle reveal animations
- Hero section, model explanation, benefits, timeline, contact forms
- Mobile-friendly responsive layout
- Simple reveal-on-scroll using IntersectionObserver
- Form integrations using Formspree (replace with your preferred form backend)
