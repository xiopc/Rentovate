# Rentovate

Landing site for Rentovate — a rent-arbitrage company that provides landlords with guaranteed agreed rent plus a share of net profits from short-term bookings while managing cleaning, maintenance and guest screening.

This repository contains a minimal, static HTML/CSS site optimized for quick preview and deployment.

What I included
- Clean, Apple‑inspired layout with generous whitespace and subtle reveal animations
- Hero section, model explanation, benefits, timeline, contact forms
- Mobile-friendly responsive layout
- Simple reveal-on-scroll using IntersectionObserver
- Form integrations using Formspree (replace with your preferred form backend)

How to preview locally
1. Clone the repo
2. Open `index.html` in your browser OR run a simple static server:

```
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open http://localhost:8000

Deploy
- Push this repo to GitHub (create repository `xiopc/Rentovate`) and enable GitHub Pages, or connect the repo to Vercel / Netlify for continuous deploys.

Next steps I can do for you
- Replace the placeholder Formspree endpoint with your own (or set up Netlify/Vercel serverless mail handler)
- Swap Unsplash images for your property photos
- Add analytics and meta/social optimizations
- Convert to Next.js or Astro with components and CMS integration
